""" This program contains two functions, the classify_triange() and valid_input()
functions. The classify_triangle() function takes three inputs, the three sides
of a triangle, and returns "Equilateral" if all three sides are equal, "Isoceles"
if two sides are equal, "Scalene" if none of the sides are equal, "Not A Triangle"
if the sum of two of the sides is less than the length of the third side, and
"Right" if the sum of two of the sides equals the square of the remaining side """
