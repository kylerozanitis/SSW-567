### This repo contains the homework assignment HW 01: Testing Triangle Classification ###

The goal of this assignment is to write a program in Python to classify triangles 
and use an automated test platform, e.g. UnitTest or PyTest, and write test cases 
to test your implementation of classifying triangles.


The 'provided' Requirements Specification:
- “Write a function classify_triangle() that takes three parameters: a, b, and c.
- The three parameters represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. 
- The function returns a string that specifies whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral, and whether it is a right triangle as well.”

Recall that:
- equilateral triangles have all three sides with the same length
- isosceles triangles have two sides with the same length
- scalene triangles have three sides with different lengths
- right triangles have three sides with lengths, a, b, and c where a^2 + b^2 = c^2
